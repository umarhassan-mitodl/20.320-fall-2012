description: Green algae grows in this bioreactor. Bioreactors are steady-state mixed
  tanks that keep organisms in permanent exponential growth while continuously diluting
  with nutrient-rich broth and removing both cells and reaction products. In the Protein
  Networks Project of this course, students model the system and design a way to keep
  the cells growing. Photograph courtesy of Umberto Salvagnin on flickr. CC-BY.
