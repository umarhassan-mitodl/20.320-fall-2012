## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _20.320 Analysis of Biomolecular and Cellular Systems_ as it was taught by Professors Forest White and Ernest Fraenkel in Fall 2012.

This course is a required part of the biological engineering undergraduate curriculum. The two central themes of the course are modeling of complex dynamic systems and protein design and engineering.

## Course Outcomes

In _20.320_, students learn how to analyze biological problems mathematically and computationally in order to guide design decisions. The scale of the problems range from proteins, through cellular signaling pathways to whole-body pharmacokinetics.

## Student Information

### Enrollment

Enrollment has varied from 40 students to 70 students; during the Fall 2012 semester, 61 students enrolled in this course. Typically, most students taking this course are third-year undergraduates majoring in biological engineering.

## Curriculum Information

### Prerequisites

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### Lecture

- Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 24 sessions total.

### Recitation

- Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 24 sessions total.
- Two sessions were created to accommodate the students’ schedules; both sessions covered the same material.
- Recitations were optional.

### Out of Class

- Read the optional {{% resource_link cebb4d77-9ee1-4d41-5e78-cb06b0277b90 "reading assignments" "#Reading_Material" %}}
